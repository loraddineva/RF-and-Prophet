The purpose of the research is to construct a predictive model of the number of cases of COVID-19, using data provided by Our World in Data. The topic is heavily featured in multiple studies since December 2019, but the continuation of the pandemic and accumulation of data allows for further improvement of the results and analysis focused on specific regions. Another topic of interest is the number of hospitalizations and specifically admissions to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The metrics are gaining importance in the light of new virus variants. We will give an overview of the approaches to estimating ICU admissions and its applicability with our available data.
